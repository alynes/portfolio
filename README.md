# Austin's Portfolio

This portfolio is a React app written entirely with functional components. 
You will not find one class-based component here, and 3rd party ingredients are kept to a bare minimum.

The two most interesting components are Swipe and Carousel3D.
<br/>


Swipe:
>Makes child elements swipe-able. You can utilize React.useEffect() in another component
to do anything based on 'x' and/or 'y' increasing or decreasing by 1.

Carousel3D:
>Places child elements into a rotating carousel that uses Swipe and smooth CSS transitions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install'

Installs dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
